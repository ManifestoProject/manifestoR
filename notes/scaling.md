# Things / Steps to consider when using the Manifesto Data


for most of these steps, there is no right or wrong, but these make different assumptions the data generating process and the nature of issues and dimensions.

## selecting cases, preprocessing

exclude estimates(progtype)

match successor parties

## coding scheme aggregation 

aggregation of cee categories

base value 

## dimensionality
measuring one issue, one latent dimensions,...

## selecting or identification of categories

theoretically driven

data-driven
- prosser
- m√∂lder

## weighting of categories

deductive (mostly no weighting)

data driven weighting 

## scaling function

linear scaling
ratio
log scaling

## smoothing procedures


## uncertainty estimates


## match with other data / rescaling

empirical or theoretical ends on different scales
