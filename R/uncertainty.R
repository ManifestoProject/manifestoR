### uncertainty estimates by michael mcdonald and ian budge

# four models:
#  - one lag
#   - one and two lags
#   - one, two, three lags
#   - no lag ?

#relative predictive power of these models
#highest adjusted r2

# If a model with fewer lags than the one first identified 
# (by virtue of its statistical significance and high adjusted-R2) 
# has a higher adjusted-R2 when the same cases are used, we chose the model with fewer lags as the preferred equation.
