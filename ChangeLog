1.2 (2016-03-21)
================
* South America Dataset and Corpus are now available in manifestoR.
The respective documents are availabe since corpus version 2016-2 and
require manifestoR 1.2 to be accessible.
* mp_availability now returns a data.frame with attributes and not a
list. This might break code backwards, you cannot acces mp_availability()$availability
any longer. What was there before is now directly the return value of
mp_availability.
* You can download the Manifesto Project Main Dataset now also
in binary formats (dta, xlsx, sav) and read it from there in order to
obtain labelled columns as in STATA.
* codes() now returns a vector and not a data.frame()
* main dataset uses strings not factors
* programmatic clarity measure implemented by Sven Regel
* Franzmann & Kaiser 2009 scaling procedure included
* With this a new function to split the Belgium party system is introduced
* Subsetting metadata now works also by year
* Citation handling for MZES documents implemented


1.1-1 (2015-11-12)
==================

* Correct and extended startup messages
* Nicheness measures by Meyer & Miller 2013 and Bischof 2015 implemented
* Corpus documents can now be accessed via their manifesto_id (= party_date) and not only by number
  * implementation change of tm Source and reader for ManifestoCorpus
* counting codes reproduces dataset style for handbook version 5: subcategories + aggregated percentages
* issue attention diversity measure after Greene implemented in issue_attention_diversity
* More user-friendly error messages in case of incorrect requests (metadata, API key)
  * fixes among others https://github.com/ManifestoProject/manifestoR/issues/1

1.0-5 (2015-09-14)
==================

* Dependency increased to dplyr 0.4.3, since 0.4.2 contains a bug affecting manifestoR code

* Citation information is now requesting the API
* Several small bugfixes
